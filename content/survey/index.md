We are Abhishek (climate scientist), Anushka (social psychologist), Shweata (science communicator), and Tanvi (sociology major) from the Young India Fellowship 2025 cohort. We’re excited to introduce Pralay, a strategy-based video game that we are developing as part of our year-long Experiential Learning Module project. But we need your help to shape it!

We’ve put together a short baseline survey to understand your thoughts on climate change. Your input will directly influence how we design the game and its impact.

As a thank you, you’ll be entered into a lottery to win CASH PRIZES and get exclusive access to the game before everyone else, free of cost!

It’ll only take a few minutes, and your feedback is invaluable! Fill out the survey here: [https://forms.office.com/r/r899VU5g3y](https://forms.office.com/r/r899VU5g3y).
