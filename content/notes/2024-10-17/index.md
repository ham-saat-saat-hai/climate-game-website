- Abhishek, Anushka, and Tanvi met for a quick meeting around setting up work to be presented during Office Hours with the ELM team and charting out our next steps during the immersion week

### Hypothesis Generation
- We set up three hypotheses that came out of our secondary research and stakeholder interaction
  - H1 – People who play the game will perform better on the post game survey than those who don't play the game
  - H2 –  People with prior knowledge on cc will be able to perform better in the pre and post surveys
  - H3 – The story of the game will be a moderator in people’s engagement with climate related attitude (information & beliefs about climate change)
-Survey will be used to develop game storyline, characters, and scenarios. Baseline understanding will help us understand what people already know and what they don’t

### Survey aspects to keep in mind
- Aiming for 400-450 responses. Pool from Ashoka and beyond
- Provide incentive to respondents. Could be some sort of cash prize along with the enviable position of playing game before anyone else
- Use Microsoft Forms to build survey

### For immersion week
- 18th Oct – Begin data collection
- 21st Oct – Develop basic aspects of the world
- 22nd Oct – Begin developing game scenarios
- Post 27th Oct – Get feedback from ClimSci experts, Narrative Experts
- Introduce team and send design note to Memesys
- Start populating website with meeting notes and other information

### Is there anything to ask the ELM team?
- Can we crowdfund so that we can get graphic designers and coders to help in development?
  Can we get the soft board that was promised to us?
  Can everyone at the office fill out our survey?
