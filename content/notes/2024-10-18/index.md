In the soundboarding meeting with Dr Kalluri, Pralay team described the game. Dr Kalluri then asked us more questions and shared his experience of developing board games.
### Dr Kalluri: What sources are you using to develop scenarios?
_Our answer: Abhishek's expertise + secondary research + personal narratives_
- Make sure to use trusted citable sources to develop scenarios if you are pitching to government or other organisations. 
- Dr Kalluri assisted in making [Master of Disaster](https://masterofdisaster.co.uk/) for India, a game originally designed by an NGO in Philippines.
- Look at NIDM's research. Adapt information on how to act at an individual level, what to not do, how to stay resilient, etc. 

## Other Feedback
- File a Joint IP when you have the prototype ready
- Have Board Games as a Plan B since developing a video game is a grand endevour.
- Have Scenario cards? Mimic real life climate action? 

## His Games
He has developed four table-top games with the help of design intern, game cafe owner and high schooler. These are based on urban design. They are so far been played in classrooms as a part of curriculum and informal get togethers.
