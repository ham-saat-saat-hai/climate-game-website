- We met with [Sayan Chaudhari](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/sayan-chaudhuri/), a Critical Writing Faculty with the YIF at Ashoka University. His class focuses on critical perspectives in education, and we thought that having his perspective for the game would help us in understanding what makes stories click for players when they are being nudged to question their existing ideas.

### Interview with Sayan

### What is the point of choices?
- Imperfect choices that make player feel in control
- Think about how decisions matter. Needs to be gradual and subtle buildup rather than ultimate decision
- Character choices would model specific desires onto game. For ex, game would feel different if main character is imperialist
- Visual component, time component can be helpful in driving urgency and magnitude of decision and dilemma


### On the narrative
- Sayan liked the idea of not having a single action that takes you closer to the goal. Ethics cannot be reinforced. Post apocalyptic games work because they are complex
- Context is extremely important. When presenting stories behind the choices on offer, they have to give a sense of groundedness
- Language in the game needs to connect micro-level actions to macro-level variables. This can happen through effective metaphors that switch between the concrete and the abstract
- Emotional registers within the story are necessary to engage people. Shock, fear, and humour are good qualities for story to have. These can also happen visually and through music
- Sayan leaned towards having the main character be someone from the aspirants. It would fit in with a heroic arc. Main character needs to have strong narrative for their motive to become president
- Hero should have some vulnerability but also courage. A tragic prehistory that needs to be resolved. Acts of courage also needs accompanying conflict where mistakes are made. This can lead to redemption arc
- An ending with a moral reckoning can be powerful. Heroes too have to be violent sometimes
- Hero should be attached to make the character feel richer. A sort of buddy, advisor, or friend. A decision taken can lead to harm to this beloved character
- Fantastical elements can be used, such as dreams or flashbacks. These can haunt the character

### Recommendations
- Characters could appear 3D to feel real and relatable
- Create online community to share strategies and promote discussions
- Hero With The Thousand Faces for narrative template
- Chat with [Krish](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/krishtijeet-das/), another CW faculty, to see how to create compelling hero arcs
