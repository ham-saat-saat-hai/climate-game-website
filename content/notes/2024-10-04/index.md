# Agenda for the day: 
- Debrief in-depth interviews.
- Refine the game’s story.
- Send a formal email to confirm mentorship.
- Prepare for the meeting with Eeshto.
# Game Development
## Game Scenarios
- Initial target of 8-10 scenarios is too few.
- Create 50+ scenarios to sift through.
## World Building: Possible storylines
- A character dies at the end, with the player facing a choice between personal loss and becoming president. Either way, someone beloved dies in an unexpected manner.
- The player does not become president and the game’s final outcome is a catastrophic collapse of the government.
- Betrayal by a beloved character who attempted an assassination of the player & a dramatic reckoning scene with a confrontation.
## Considerations
- Is the game visually achievable and emotionally compelling?
- Does it avoid losing the plot or repetition while driving the story forward?
# Meeting with Eeshto
- Support from their end: beta testing, pre/post survey, and hackathon in late October.
- Explore 8-bit aesthetics similar to Undertale.
- They recommended GoDot over Unreal Engine for flexibility and non-realistic visuals.
- Their team has a graphic design expert and narrative expert who are willing to work with us (names not mentioned for privacy).
- QA Testing across different perspectives (gamers & non-gamers).
- Suggested using Qualtrics for economic and psychological elements.
- Adviced us to discuss PC requirements with Prof. Debayan.
- Potential game jam or hackathon (with food) in collaboration with Eeshto and Pralay.
- Suggested [itch.io](https://itch.io/jams) for game jams and [The India Game Developer Conference (IGDC)](https://indiagdc.com/)
