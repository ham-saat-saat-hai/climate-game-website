## Notes
- We discussed the insights on project progress, YIF team engagement, team engagement, and learning through the project. We had consensus on most of the aspects, except for team engagment. The barometer responses were reminder to ensure all for four of us are consulted before taking a decision.
- We have our gmail and instagram accounts :)
- We brainstormed the ideas for the board game. We thought through how characters interact with resources, the kinds of decisions, how the decisions are made, and so on.
