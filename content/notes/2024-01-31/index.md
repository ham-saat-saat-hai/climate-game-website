We had a busy and exciting time at the India Science Festival (ISF) at Fergusson College this January, where we presented a board game version of Pralay. We had around 500 participants play our game :) AND, and all of them enjoyed playing. For us, as game developers, it was a pure joy to see audience meaningfully engage with the game. By meaninfully, we mean that the players "got" the game and strategised to win while ensure the best for the fictional world. We also had an activity, where we asked the participants to read the headlines to guess which ones were fake. The activity gathered equally good response facilitating conversations around misinformation, news framing, and emotions the headlines elicit.

This week, there was also a Hindu feature of our game, which very explains the mechanics of playing it. ([non-paywalled link](https://web.archive.org/web/20250130064905/https://www.thehindu.com/education/gamifying-education-how-board-and-digital-games-are-changing-learning/article69155200.ece) :P)
