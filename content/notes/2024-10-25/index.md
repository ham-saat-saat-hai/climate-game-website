# Game Scenario

## Seraphis Energy Network -- Tanvi
The Seraphis Energy Network is a project designed to transport crystalized energy cores (called Seraphis Stones), an incredibly potent and rare energy source found deep within the subterranean layers of Aalim, across the continent to its southern port cities. From there, the energy cores will be shipped to the continent of Trushna (Aspirants), which is suffering from energy shortages. The Seraphis Stones are coveted not only for their ability to power entire cities for decades but also for their potential to be weaponized, making this project a matter of global importance. The SEN is proposed to run through several sensitive areas, including Indari lands, home to the indigenous Indaril people (some of the first 2k people on Prapanch - this is one such diaspora in Aalim), who have lived on these lands for centuries. The pipeline would also cut through fragile ecosystems that host ancient forests and rivers. 

The initial project is estimated at 85 trillion credits, with the potential for cost overruns due to the unstable tectonic conditions along the route. However, the long-term projected profits from exporting Seraphis Stones to Trushna (Aspirants) and Varutri (Providers) could exceed 500 trillion credits over a century. 

## Climate Cage Conspiracy -- Anushka
Tryshan is part of the Ministry of Faith and is on the campaign trail. Her opponent, in an campaign speech, mentions the Climate Cage conspiracy. The theory claims that the Aalim/Lalit are intentionally manufacturing the climate crisis to control Prapanch’s population, particularly those in Varutri/Prakrit and Trushna/Yatharth. The theory posits that the “elite” want to keep “ordinary” citizens locked in ‘climate cages’ which are zones with limited freedom, resources and movement. Supposed leaks of fabricated maps and images have begun circulating, suggesting that the government has identified locations for these “cages”, sparking fear, anger, and resistance.

## Crop Improvement vs Climate-Proofing her district -- Shweata
Tryshan has been elected by her district. She becomes part of the Ministry of Faith. She wants to invest in researching genetically modified crops to improve yield. There is a flash flood that happens in her district (*Based on CEEW Documentary Series: Faces of Climate Resilience). Her ministry has a tight budget and she can either invest in climate-proofing the flooded area or in improving yield. What would she pick? 

# Scenario Sequence
- The first 3-4 scenarios could have simpler decisions. Like Crop Improvement vs Climate-Proofing
- As game developers, let's be aware of the complexities like the knowledge-hoarding, however the players get to know later in the game. (Inspiration: Rowling introduced Deathly Hallows later in the Harry Potter series but she as an author knew about it since book 02)
- Have a different character take decisons in certain scenarios
