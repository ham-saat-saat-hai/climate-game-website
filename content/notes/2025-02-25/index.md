## Brainstorming session for Logo
Abhishek and Shweata had a brainstomring session for faction logo inspirations. We looked at various Indian art forms and tattoo patterns.

## Meeting Graphics Design Expert
We met Deepak from the Ashoka University team to discuss the aesthetics and branding for our game. Several useful ideas/suggestions emerged as a consequence. Some listed below--
- exploring tamrind seeds or even stones for tokens
- having a brand manual
- setting up social media accounts and owning multiple domain names

It was also good to know that we were on the right track with the designs and logos we had come up with thus far.

## Buying Domain Name
We finally bought a domain name :) Sadly, pralay.in and pralay.com are already taken. We settled for pralaythegame.com (one of the team members does not like the domain, but it cannot be helped). We will soon start building a public-facing landing page for the board game using open-source framework and Netlify.

## Concretizing the details of Prapanch
We listed down some questions about the history and the present of Prapanch. For example, how does healthcare system function, which religions are followed, how communication works, who has a monopoly over fossil fuels, etc.
