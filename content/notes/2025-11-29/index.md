## Outreach: 
- Shweata met Matthew, possible collaboration with Climate Academcy
- Tanvi in touch with CEEW.

*ACTION*: Make our website more informational.

## Website:
 - How to build community? Have signed-up meetings. Fun, engaging, etc. Like an informal podcast session, almost.
 - Basic climate information
- Pull together existing presentations, videos, etc.

## Why are we building Pralay? What is the intent?
- Climate curiosity
- Pralay as agenda-setter; conversation-continuer (when the climate conversations are dying in the popular discourse)
- Anushka's framework: Knowing-Believing-Doing. Going from knowing to believing is feasible. 
- Building a climate game that gets picked up by as many people as possible. Games to represent diverse and complex ways of thinking, structure, and content

ACTIONS:

- How to make the dilemma with complexities, and represent realities in interesting.
- Increasing the narrative depth through more backstory building, character story building.
- Make character stories: write the script for their 'election video pitches'.
- Think of dilemma cards a part of the story.
- Categorise dilemma---maybe make use of the milestones that go around the Jalwa index.
- Shweata to talk to her peers on working on our intents better
- All to have conversations with players who previously played the game. What can they recall? Do they recall anything at all? Has the game had any influence (do you google more, does it influencing your thinking about real-life situations)?
