## General Points on Table
Happy New Year! 

- We may need a course correction; we may be diverging to much. Too many threads open!
    - To address the problem of having too many threads open, we need to have an elaborate to-do list. @tanvi to make a to-do list.
- The Christmas break was unexpected; better communication from the team!
- We need a better log of all the engagements so far. For example, over the last two months:
    - Abhishek met with CEEW; useful feedback gathered.
    - Abhishek registered for MeepleCon in Mumbai.
    - Tanvi and Shweata registered for Play For Planet; there are other events hosted by the department at University of York.
- We should make a general pitch deck.
- We also need to figure out long term financing for the game; the pitch deck might help.

## Final Comments
- We spent an hour and half listing out tasks, ordering them by priority. Hopefully, it'll help us get the ball rolling.
