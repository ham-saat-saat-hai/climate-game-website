### Notes:

-- Memesys message – “Please shoot us an email with as much detail as you have about this game - a design note about the game, what the ambition is, what the mechanics are, how you plan to develop it. That'll give us a good sense of things, and something to respond to. here's zain and my email IDs:
#### Ideas: 

##### BG Story– to set up the world and create a sense of continued historicity

-Inciting incident → Huge spaceship from earth to new planet (humans) → govt established + new factions (animation)
-Shweata Hegde Relationship between earth and new planet? Yes or no? Maybe ask storyteller people also - single line connection to earth or fully new planet? 
Figure out timeline, years. 
-Tanvi Saxena Cannot be talking about the past - ‘he who must not be named type - power dynamics - hush hush. 

##### Main Character–

- Drive narrative ahead - main character having convo with strong bond person → convey message through these conversations and this person → melodramatic and tragic past - dream or flashbacks or future premonition type (but this is doomism so no tx)

##### Themes–

- Magical realism Surrealism to drive story forward - not actual magic but just vibez 
names/words - very indian - use sanskrit/old stuff but should be understandable to all indians, common. 
- Connection: established factions connected with blocks with old planets. 
- Design for the game - narrative story, repeated patterns, font, animation, color palette. Different phases within the game + hero’s journey + Dan Harmon story circle (anushka no want zone of comfort) = create story circle!! 
- Figure out env scenarios - how many, larger plot or what. 
Maybe blue-green-purple vibe with a hint of yellow? Opal/Lapis Lazuli, Emerald/Jade, Amethyst, Topaz



### Deadline: 
18th (wednesday) - meeting for aesthetics of game
19th (thursday) - lit review

### Next meeting:
