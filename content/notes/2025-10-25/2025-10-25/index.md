- _A lot of chatter and goss about this year’s YIF_
- Meet few hours a week (Saturday 1400 BST), use the time to also co-work and discuss
- Re-look at the previous to-do lists: http://pralay.netlify.app/notes/2025-07-01/
- Anushka shared her game-morning experience. All players immediately understood the game Suggestions–Chaos odds need more evidence? Metrics need to be thought about more carefully; need to be more embedded in the story.
- On how to assign metrics? All four of us come up with a method 
- Comments from the original spreadsheet to be discussed
- Abhishek to write a script for the introduction to game sessions
- Something to discuss. Jalwa index. How does the Jalwa index affect Khayal?
Have a sheet, with character details, voting, etc.?

## To-Do’s for Next week
- Anushka and Shweata to present their standardising metric
- Abhishek to present a rough game introduction script (concept sheet)
- Everyone to discuss the first spreadsheet

## To-Do’s for Subsequent week
On Jalwa, how it affects everything in the game
