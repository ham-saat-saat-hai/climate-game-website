# Meeting with Prof. Gautam Menon
We gave him a brief of our game and ran him through our mock game scenaio. 
## Feedback  
- He offered to serve as a sounding board for our project.
- Told us to integrate elements such as CO2 levels into the game.
- Discussed making the game credible 
- Recommended contacting Siddhart Kankaria for further advice.
