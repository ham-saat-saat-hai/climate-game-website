## Meeting with Arushi
Abhishek and Shweata met Arushi to discuss the design of the board and the box. After spending an hour explaining the game, Arushi suggested we first write the history of the factions and characters (a typical individual of all factions + 6 role-play characters) to help her start with the design. The details of the specific tasks are yet to be detailed.

We will also set up a meeting with Tanishka to discuss the clothing of the characters. 

## Update on Game Simulation
After running simulation based on the current game mechanics, we realised that the game is highly disadvantageous to Prakrit. It narraowed down to the fact that Prakrit can only bet at most 3 tokens per round. Therefore, Abhishek suggested that we limit the number of tokens available for the player to risk. Out of 75 Janta available to a player, for example, only 12 would be available at the beginning of the game for them to risk, with 2 being replinished from the out-of-play stock. With this adjusted, the game seems more balanced. The exact number of active tokens in the bank needs to be determined.
