For Pralay, April has been the month of intense work. As we gear up for the Phase 02 review, we managed to put out the first version of our game and hosted a couple of game nights for beta-testing. It was very fulfilling to see our game in action.

## First Week of April
We finalised game designs, proof-read dilemma cards, designed the cards, wrote the rule book and printed all of them out. Cutting and pasting took longer than expected---spanning many many hours. But with that, we had the final game ready.

## Preparation for ELM Phase 02 Review
For the past three days, we have been working very hard to come up with a good set of final presentations, final pitch video and presentation of the game itself.

We have made a separate post on game nights :)
