## Kickstarter Session
We discussed potential business model for the board game version of Pralay and strategised how to get our first 100 and 1000 customers.

## Meeting with Tanishka
Abhishek and Shweata met Tanishka to discuss a design collaboration. Tanishka agreed to help us style our characters and work in tandem with Arushi on the overall aesthetics of the game.

## Pralay Backstory
We created a document with backstory of human's migration to Prapanch and details about factions. Hopefully, this will help Arushi and Tanishka in their design process and help us in writing dilemma cards.
