#### Things to ask: 



-- Record and Transcribe, ask permission.

##### Forest people: 
-- Talk about climate – what do you think CC is? Personal experience? Nudge more info out. (figure out baseline of understanding, can be a gap through which we approach our scenarios)
Level of confidence - the degree of certainty or conviction of your belief. How you sound, emotionality. How ready you are to recognise that you may not know the most.  Level of understanding 
-- If good enough understanding - How did you first come across the issue of cc? When,where, how, why? What did it make you think/feel? What is your relationship with cc now - how and why do you engage with it? To what extent and how often? What do you think about a climate change game, regardless of whether you would play it or no? What do you think we should absolutely do in this game? ask Qs about awareness, how they reached their current understanding, ways in which game should approach decisions, if you were a player what would you like most
-- If not good enough understanding - (may be confused or disengaged) do you believe in CC? Do you ever engage with climate news/information? If yes, how/when/why? What does it make you think/feel?If no, why? What does it make you think/feel?
