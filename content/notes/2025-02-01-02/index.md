Abhishek (and Shweata) have started to write the code to run Monto Carlo Simulation. The code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ham-saat-saat-hai/dilemma-card-points-simulation) (it is private Repo right now. let us know if you need access).

Simultaneously, Tanvi is looking at Janta token denominations. We need to account for how many Janta tokens would be there on the board at all times, and whether the players would at all times have the number of Janta tokens that they would like to bid.

We also have to parallely figure out how to produce the game box and other game elements. Anushka is researching about our printing options.
