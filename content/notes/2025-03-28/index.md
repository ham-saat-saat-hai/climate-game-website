##  Content for Dilemma Cards
At long last, we were able to _finally_ complete development and editing on 60 dilemma cards. I (Anushka) had tears in my eyes by the end of it, but we can't wait to test these out. 

## Going forward with game elements
Tanvi sourced and started the production process for wood-carved Janta tokens. They look gorgeous (designed by Abhishek) and we'll soon have our hands on them.

##  Design
Abhishek, Tanvi, and our honorary member Arushi have been spending insane hours to finesse the design of the game. Faction symbols good to go, and board revisions underway. Next up- cards and box. Also, Kush (another fellow Fellow) has helped out with cute, handmade pouches for the tokens.

All in all, there's massive work happening as we approach our ELM deadline. In some ways, it feels like the final stamp on something big. In other ways, it feels like nothing at all considering we still have a long way to go before making our quaint ELM project (I don't think it was ever quaint) available to the public. Even longer before we can test it out.
