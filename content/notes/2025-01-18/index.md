# What SS Says
- "Poley-Poley" (one step at a time); plan day by day

# What are 5 execution tasks toward product and commercial northstar goals?
  ## Product
  
  - play testing; user testing
  - design upgrades
  - looking into production (materials, supply, brand)
  - companion app (rules, leaderboards, community, purchasing, add-ons like narrative and story aspect)
  - develop a research proposal for study (game as intervention)

  ## Commercial
  
  - marketing (building a brand, using SM, creating a community)
  - financial viability, funding options
  - market reach- finding a perfect number
  - merchandising?
  - IP
  - existing gaming communities- become a part of tabletop culture

    # TAM- Total Addressable Market (Total demand for a product/service)

    - top down estimation and bottom up estimation
   - TAM (top down)
     - how many people spend on leisure?
     - out of this, how many spend how much on activities? (gaming cafes?)
     - of this, how many exclusively spend on movies? how many spend on books? (basically, those not playing games)
     - TAM is those who don't currently play games but interact with stories + those who do
  - TAM (bottom up)
      - interactions in and around Ashoka and Delhi-NCR
      - What percentage played games? What percentage cared about climate? What cared about both? Demographics.
      - Can be expanded to major metros (north, west, east, south)
      - Can be extrapolated to country?
      - Can be extrapolated to global communities (see Monopoly)
