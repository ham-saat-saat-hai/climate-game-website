After debriefing about ISF, we worked on the following:
- Reimagining Jalwa Index. There needs to be a general increase in the overall Jalwa index as the number of rounds progress. We also have to decide on the units for the jalwa index and how to better depict it on the board. For now we have a scale. Some alternative ideas are:
   - Having a pot/box with Jalwa Index Units that gets drawn out or added to
   - Having a small pole structure to which you stack Jalwa Index Units (I'm not doing a good job in explaining this)

- Characters. Some characters were professions, whereas others were identities. Therefore, to homogenise, we decided to re-do our characters. Our new list consists of: 
   - Researcher
   - Tech Tycoon
   - Union Leader
   - Artist
   - Indie Journalist
   - Ambassdor
   
   These characters can have identities described in their descriptions (an activist artist, a capitailist tech tycoon, and so on). We also need to re-work the advantages conferred to the characters. Chance cards could also be used to bring these advantages to stay.

- We also need a systematic method to assign various variables to the dilemma cards. Therefore, we decided to write code to run Monto Carlo Simulations.
