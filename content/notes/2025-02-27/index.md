## New content for Dilemma Cards
We came up with ~20 new dilemma card ideas. In total, we have about 50 of them. Our goal is to make it to around 100 ideas and pick the best 60.

## Language Edits for Dilemma Card Contents
Anushka has been working on making the dilemma descriptions crisp.

## Faction Logo Design
Abhishek, Arushi, Shweata and Tanvi have had couple of brainstorming conversations for how the logos for each faction would look like. The design process is coming along well. We are mainly playing around with hexagon and symmetry with motifs specific to each faction.

## Faction Balance for Khayal
Abhishek and Shweata worked out the math for how many decisions should have Khayal within a specific range. We have for now infused a slight disadvantage to Prakrit (they have more number of cards with negative Khayal). These numbers haven't been simulation-tested, yet. Once we have a critical mass of dilemma cards ready, we plan to run the simultation and balance accordingly.
