We met [Dr Alexander Philips](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/alexander-phillips/), an English Professor at Ashoka University after discovering he teaches a course called Climate Fiction. He had suggestions on our game’s narrative and useful resources to share.
## On the Narrative
### General Feedback
- Make the narrative less didactic. Use the theme climate less to make it less preachy
- Capture reality of politics - immediate issues and maybe not long term (?)
- Think about how to tackle the problem of representing something as vast as the atmosphere
### How do you balance between info dumping and fun?
- You have to infodump at times
- Maybe have the player be a politician or activist?
- A smart politician would use the Factsheet (the infodump)
### How do we end the game?
- Leave with ambiguity. You become president, but at what cost? 
- End with a cliffhanger. You become the president and suddenly new environmental crisis emerges.
