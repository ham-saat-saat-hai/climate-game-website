Reforming Dilemma Cards:
- Have a scan QR Code which leads to the explanation and duplicate of the card (Augmented QR, uniquely encoded and decoded). App as an interface of this information. The prototype works!
- Title: is it necessary
- Description: too much text?
- Design
   - Change the order of the metrics: _Khayal_, _Jalwa_, Chaos
   - Have a visual metric?
   - Highlight the text and correlate with options
   - Have a bifurcation between options in the description; continue the same design to the metrics?
   - Have all the items on one side
   - Increase the size of the card and have a box for the card
-
