# About Pralay
Pralay is a strategy-based video game focused on climate change awareness. The game is acts as a science communication tool to inspire behavioural changes regarding climate change. To achieve this, Pralay will combine engaging storytelling, innovative gameplay, and strategic decision-making.
# Pralay's Website

The website is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), a static site generator and uses [Blowfish Theme](https://blowfish.page/) (it's really cool). The website is a living document with all our meeting notes, game design notes, crazy ideas, failures, and challenges we face.

# [For Team] How to add meeting notes to the website
Static Site Generators separate content from style.
To update the website
- navigate the `climate-game-website/content/notes`
- create a new folder for the note with the date as the folder name (for example `2024-09-13`)
- Within the created folder, create a new `index.md` file
- Add the Frontmatter
```

title: "2024-09-13 ELM Day 01"
date: 2024-09-05
description: "ELM Day 01"
