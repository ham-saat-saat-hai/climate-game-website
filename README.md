# About Pralay
Pralay is a strategy-based video game focused on climate change awareness. Our goal is to utilize video games as a science communication tool to inspire behavioural changes regarding climate change. To achieve this, Pralay will combine engaging storytelling, innovative gameplay, and strategic decision-making.
# Pralay's Website

The website is built on Hugo and uses Blowfish Theme (it's really cool). The website is a living document with all our meeting notes, crazy ideas, failures, and challenges we face.
