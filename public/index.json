We also have to decide on the units for the jalwa index and how to better depict it on the board. For now we have a scale. Some alternative ideas are:\nHaving a pot/box with Jalwa Index Units that gets drawn out or added to Having a small pole structure to which you stack Jalwa Index Units (I\u0026rsquo;m not doing a good job in explaining this) Characters. Some characters were professions, whereas others were identities. Therefore, to homogenise, we decided to re-do our characters. Our new list consists of:\nResearcher Tech Tycoon Union Leader Artist Indie Journalist Ambassdor These characters can have identities described in their descriptions (an activist artist, a capitailist tech tycoon, and so on). We also need to re-work the advantages conferred to the characters. Chance cards could also be used to bring these advantages to stay.\nWe also need a systematic method to assign various variables to the dilemma cards. Therefore, we decided to write code to run Monto Carlo Simulations.\n","date":"31 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/notes/2025-02-01/","section":"Meeting Notes","summary":"","title":"2025-01-31","type":"notes"},{"content":"These are our meeting notes if you are curious to get some insiders information about our climate game.\n","date":"31 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/notes/","section":"Meeting Notes","summary":"","title":"Meeting Notes","type":"notes"},{"content":"","date":"31 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Pralay -- The Climate Game","summary":"","title":"Pralay -- The Climate Game","type":"page"},{"content":"We had a busy and exciting time at the India Science Festival (ISF) at Fergusson College this January, where we presented a board game version of Pralay. We had around 500 participants play our game :) AND, and all of them enjoyed playing. For us, as game developers, it was a pure joy to see audience meaningfully engage with the game. By meaninfully, we mean that the players \u0026ldquo;got\u0026rdquo; the game and strategised to win while ensure the best for the fictional world. We also had an activity, where we asked the participants to read the headlines to guess which ones were fake.

A major internal question we had was regarding how the tokens move ahead, which we eventually figured out. However, there were some more points that came up:\nGame Mechanics: Make a point calculation matrix Advantages: Ensure balance Content: Use more accessible language to rewrite Design: too many tokens on the board Aesthetics: the colours, game cards, and so on Roleplaying: Ensure that the player is incentivised to be the character Balance between story and the board game mechanics Rethink Jalwa Index\u0026mdash;how much should it fluctuate?

From there, the energy cores will be shipped to the continent of Trushna (Aspirants), which is suffering from energy shortages. The Seraphis Stones are coveted not only for their ability to power entire cities for decades but also for their potential to be weaponized, making this project a matter of global importance. The SEN is proposed to run through several sensitive areas, including Indari lands, home to the indigenous Indaril people (some of the first 2k people on Prapanch - this is one such diaspora in Aalim), who have lived on these lands for centuries. The pipeline would also cut through fragile ecosystems that host ancient forests and rivers.\nThe initial project is estimated at 85 trillion credits, with the potential for cost overruns due to the unstable tectonic conditions along the route. However, the long-term projected profits from exporting Seraphis Stones to Trushna (Aspirants) and Varutri (Providers) could exceed 500 trillion credits over a century.\nClimate Cage Conspiracy \u0026ndash; Anushka # Tryshan is part of the Ministry of Faith and is on the campaign trail. Her opponent, in an campaign speech, mentions the Climate Cage conspiracy. The theory claims that the Aalim/Lalit are intentionally manufacturing the climate crisis to control Prapanch’s population, particularly those in Varutri/Prakrit and Trushna/Yatharth. The theory posits that the “elite” want to keep “ordinary” citizens locked in ‘climate cages’ which are zones with limited freedom, resources and movement. Supposed leaks of fabricated maps and images have begun circulating, suggesting that the government has identified locations for these “cages”, sparking fear, anger, and resistance.\nCrop Improvement vs Climate-Proofing her district \u0026ndash; Shweata # Tryshan has been elected by her district. She becomes part of the Ministry of Faith. She wants to invest in researching genetically modified crops to improve yield. There is a flash flood that happens in her district (*Based on CEEW Documentary Series: Faces of Climate Resilience). Her ministry has a tight budget and she can either invest in climate-proofing the flooded area or in improving yield. What would she pick?\nDiscussion on Scenarios # The first 3-4 scenarios could have simpler decisions. Like Crop Improvement vs Climate-Proofing As game developers, let\u0026rsquo;s be aware of the complexities like the knowledge-hoarding, however the players get to know later in the game. (Inspiration: Rowling introduced Deathly Hallows later in the Harry Potter series but she as an author knew about it since book 02) Have a different character take decisons in certain scenarios (?) Make a scenario framework. The developers (i.e., us) follow it to ensure that there is uniformity in the scenarios and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to code later. Maybe base the framework on existing decision-making frameworks out there? Or make a tree diagram of sorts? Or have scoring for metrics? How would the game end?

His class focuses on critical perspectives in education, and we thought that having his perspective for the game would help us in understanding what makes stories click for players when they are being nudged to question their existing ideas. Interview with Sayan # What is the point of choices? # Imperfect choices that make player feel in control Think about how decisions matter. Needs to be gradual and subtle buildup rather than ultimate decision Character choices would model specific desires onto game. For ex, game would feel different if main character is imperialist Visual component, time component can be helpful in driving urgency and magnitude of decision and dilemma On the narrative # Sayan liked the idea of not having a single action that takes you closer to the goal. Ethics cannot be reinforced. Post apocalyptic games work because they are complex Context is extremely important. When presenting stories behind the choices on offer, they have to give a sense of groundedness Language in the game needs to connect micro-level actions to macro-level variables. This can happen through effective metaphors that switch between the concrete and the abstract Emotional registers within the story are necessary to engage people. Shock, fear, and humour are good qualities for story to have. These can also happen visually and through music Sayan leaned towards having the main character be someone from the aspirants. It would fit in with a heroic arc. Main character needs to have strong narrative for their motive to become president Hero should have some vulnerability but also courage. A tragic prehistory that needs to be resolved. Acts of courage also needs accompanying conflict where mistakes are made. This can lead to redemption arc An ending with a moral reckoning can be powerful. Heroes too have to be violent sometimes Hero should be attached to make the character feel richer. A sort of buddy, advisor, or friend. A decision taken can lead to harm to this beloved character Fantastical elements can be used, such as dreams or flashbacks.

Disengagement with the world we are currently in - distinct future/parallel universe.

Sampling using satellites, dug up ices – and we are statistically confident of the reported average global temperature. How do we communicate such facts and nuances?
