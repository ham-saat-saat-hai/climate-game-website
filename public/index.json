He had suggestions on our game’s narrative and useful resources to share.\nOn the Narrative # General Feedback # Make the narrative less didactic. Use the theme climate less to make it less preachy Capture reality of politics - immediate issues and maybe not long term (?) Think about how to tackle the problem of representing something as vast as the atmosphere How do you balance between info dumping and fun? # You have to infodump at times Maybe have the player be a politician or activist? A smart politician would use the Factsheet (the infodump) How do we end the game? # Leave with ambiguity. You become president, but at what cost? End with a cliffhanger. You become the president and suddenly new environmental crisis emerges.

Dr Kalluri assisted in making Master of Disaster for India, a game originally designed by an NGO in Philippines. Look at NIDM\u0026rsquo;s research.

Sampling using satellites, dug up ices – and we are statistically confident of the reported average global temperature. How do we communicate such facts and nuances?
